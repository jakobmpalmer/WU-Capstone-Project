Background and Introduction
 
The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) believes that by the end of the century our planet will warm by 2°C as 
a result of global warming (Archer et al., 2019, p.1). Global warming is caused by a greenhouse effect when gasses such as 
carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane are trapped in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is produced as living creatures breathe.
Nitrous oxide is found in many fertilizers as well as animal excrement. Finally, methane is produced naturally in wetlands, 
and as a result of humans from rice paddies, gas drilling, coal mining, and manure. These gasses absorb energy from heat in the
atmosphere and radiate this energy in the lower bounds of our atmosphere making it warmer (Brown & Leonard, 2015). This creates
potential risk for many animals and ecosystems alike, the disruption of which would have many correlated negative impacts. 
Archer et al. (2019) make the following claim “Such increases in extreme temperatures are likely to have a negative impact on 
public health all along the mid-Atlantic, as high temperatures are associated with increased mortality.'' It is imperative 
that these damaging practices be evaluated and changed as necessary.
 
One approach at trying to aid the climate change issue is to look at environmentally harmful behaviors of people, and how to 
influence individuals to change them. Researchers created the term Behavioral Change Techniques, or BCT. In their paper 
GarnettCrane West Brown and Michie define BCTs with the following, “BCTs are defined as the smallest, observable, replicable 
components with the potential to bring about change in behavior” (Garnett et al., 2015, p.2). These BCTs are tools used to 
achieve behavioral change and can be used to resolve design strategies in hopes of better accomplish this goal.
 
Arguably one of society’s most pressing concerns it that of the environment; it is at the brink of collapse. Humans have been 
great contributors to this reality, as many lead lives where the environment is disregarded. It is necessary for individuals 
to change environmentally harmful habits in favor of a more sustainable lifestyle. To do so it is relevant to further explore 
Behavioral Change Techniques (BCT), and how to utilize them to foster a sustainable mindset. This paper will investigate human
activities that harm the ecosystem, and how to better use technology to influence sustainable behavior by the means of BCTs.
